INTRODUCTION TO UNIX:
Unix is a multi-user, multitasking operating system (OS) that controls hardware and software, allocates resources, and schedules tasks.
Unix is designed for flexibility and adaptability, and offers portability, stability, and interoperability across a range of device types and environments.
It's made up of three parts:
The kernel
The hub of the operating system, it allocates time and memory to programs and handles the filestore and communications.
Shell
Interprets commands and calls the desired program. The shell uses standard syntax for all commands.
